# RAPH-Model
RAPH Model is a detection tool for email phishing using NLP Techniques in Python
The model was created using Python language and its libraries. 
The model relies on natural language processing techniques to analyze the Arabic content of the emails and perform multiple comparisons at the word,root and phrase levels most commonly used in the phishing emails.
The model works by directly connecting to any Gmail account or any account affiliated with the University of Mosul email domain, and performs analysis, comparison and processing in real time. 
Also, a dataset of Arabic phishing emails and legitimate emails was created that includes 1250 emails, as well as creating two datasets for comparison: 
The first included a list of the most common phishing words, and the second included a list of the most commonly used phrases in phishing.
